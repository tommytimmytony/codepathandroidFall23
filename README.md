## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- There was alot of research needed inorder for me to implement many functions of the app (scrollView, change font color, change font size, design a custom dialog, passing data, and many more).
- Had alot of difficulties dealing with the constraints. I spent alot of time figuring out how to set constraint for every component. Sometime the project look good, but when emulated it will look terrible and disorganized, due to the constraints.
- Small Bugs such as ImageView won't show any image. I found out that because I'm using the word "tools" instead of "app" to set the image.
